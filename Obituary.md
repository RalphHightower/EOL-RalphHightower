# Obituary: Ralph Hightower, Jr
## Bio
Ralph Maxwell Hightower Jr was born to Ralph Hightower Sr (Mac) and Marilyn Fox Hightower on May 23, 1954 in Bamberg, SC. Surviving are his 
wife, Paula Hightower, formerly Paula Lynn Lambert from Harlem, GA, sister Elizabeth Woodall living in Bamberg, SC, and brother Chester Hightower living in Aiken,  SC.  Although Ralph and Paula had no children, they have adopted and bred Beagles, with many as members of their household; some have competed in obedience, show confirmation, and performance (Fast CAT). He rejoins those Beagles from the past that have led the way and patiently waiting for on the other side of the Rainbow Bridge. 
He graduated from Bamberg-Ehrhardt High School in 1971 and the University of South Carolina with a BS degree in Computer Science in 1976. 
He played tenor saxophone in the Bamberg-Ehrhardt Marching Band and Concert Band and a few years in the USC Marching Band and Concert Band and baritone sax in the jazz band. 
He was also a DJ at WUSC-AM playing rock music; it wasn't called classic rock back then. Of note, he was on the air when then Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. 
He was employed by NCR for fourteen years, where he met his wife (he didn't realize that his start date of February 14, 1977 was significant), and retired from SC Department of Health and Environmental Control after fourteen years. In between, he worked for a few banks, an insurance software company, a telecom company as a contractor, and a few DOT-BOMBs (DOT-COM business failures).
## Interests
### NASA
Ralph was only four years older than NASA and followed NASA exploration in space beginning with manned spaceflight, Mercury through Apollo, the Space Shuttle and International Space Station, and unmanned space probes and instruments. He witnessed two final spaceflights in person, 
the U.S. half of the Apollo/Soyuz Test Project in July 1975 and the final Space Shuttle launch in July 2011 with Atlantis; he also got to witness the final landing near the Control Tower for the Shuttle Landing ramp, just 200 yards away from touchdown and final wheel stop.
### Water Skiing 
Ralph enjoyed water skiing, initially learning on Lake Greenwood. He also skied on two other South Carolina lakes, Clark Hill Lake *(don’t correct it to Lake Thurmond)* and many times on Lake Murray. While he was in Cedar Rapids, IA, he skied on the Cedar River in Cedar Rapids and the Mississippi River between the Quad Cities (Bettendorf and Davenport, IA and Rock Island and Moline, IL).
### Photography 
Ralph got interested in photography using his parent’s Polaroid Land Camera. After marriage, he bought a Canon A-1 and added a few accessories along the way. He added one of his bucket list cameras, a used Canon F-1N, with the AE Finder FN and the AE Motor Drive FN. 
Paula had been encouraging him to go digital and finally bought him a Canon EOS 5D III for Christmas. Paula and he attended the Wednesday 2015 practice round of The Masters when cameras are allowed. 
### Beagles
Ralph and Paula have adopted and bred Beagles as members of the family with some competing in obedience; they each have put Companion Dog titles on four dogs. They also compete in AKC confirmation putting Championship titles on a few.
