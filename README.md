End Of Life information for survivor and/or executors, probate. I have a Gary Larson, "Far Side", sense of humor, so the term, EOL, commonly used by Microsoft for End Of Life fits.

I got the idea from [Chrissy LeMaire â€” @potatoqualitee](https://github.com/potatoqualitee %}) [eol-dr](https://github.com/potatoqualitee/eol-dr %}) during a Women In Technology webinar on Mental Health Awareness Day on April 8, 2021.
